Plants need more water under some circumstances, such as with lower humidity (heating/air conditioning), a lot of sunlight, a higher temperature and during the flowering period. In winter it is also a lot colder, so plants need less water."

This makes your plant look prettier and they can put their energy into the living leaves. Your plant will also be very happy with a plant sprayer! Spray the plant regularly to improve humidity, keep the leaves clean and reduce the risk of pests. Finally, we recommend that you give the plant some plant nutrition once every 1 to 2 weeks during the growth period."
